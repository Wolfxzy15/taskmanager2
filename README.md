This is another version of the TTGC Challenge using Xampp and MYSQL because as I was learning Laravel through Youtube they were using a database so I had to as well. 
Note:
To run the code open terminal and type "php artisan serve"
open a new terminal and type "npm run dev"

DATABASE!!!
I have included my database file on database folder named task_manager.sql
